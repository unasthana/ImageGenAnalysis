## Image Generation Analysis for Imbalanced Datasets

## Overview

In this project, we investigate using generative models such as GAN and Stable Diffusion to mitigate the class imbalance issue in datasets. We construct and train GAN from the ground up to demonstrate the performance of the Stable Diffusion model in comparison. We use an open-source Stable Diffusion model. We evaluate the  datasets obtained with the different methods using the ResNet-18 classifier.
